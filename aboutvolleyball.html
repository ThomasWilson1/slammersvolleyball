<h1>About Volleyball</h1>
<p>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a court divided by a net.</p>
<p>The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that is being received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports.</p>
<p>The object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court.</p>
<p>the ball is put into play by the right back-row player, who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court.</p>
<p>A team is allowed to hti the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court.</p>

<p>The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out", or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.</p>

<p>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point, and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.</p>
<p>The best of three or five games will win the match. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum of a two-point advantage.</p>
<p>If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
