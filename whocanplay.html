<h1>Who Can Play?</h1>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun, and does not require extreme fitness. There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.</p>
<p>Since you do not have to move around the court too much, it's great for people who want a low-impact sport that will get them fit without pushing them too hard.</p>
<p>For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because gaes can be really exciting and intense, but there's always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
<p>Beach Volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike!</p>
<p><strong>Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should consult with their doctor beforehand.</strong></p>
